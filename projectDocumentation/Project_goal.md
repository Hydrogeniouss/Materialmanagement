Our Project is an administration software to rent equipment inside the organisation of the Friends of Nature (NF). The goal is that less material gets lost and the expenses for replacements is sinking.

**Must Haves**
Equipment can be lent quick and easily over the application. That is needed because otherwise members will forget or skip it. The same goes for giving back equipment. The application must load fast and has a smooth flow. For the sake of member identification, a name and small password is needed to log in. 

An Administrator has to have the possibility to add new Equipment in case the NF increases complement equipment. Moreover old or broken equipment should be deletable.
To Know who has what materials, the administrator should be able to follow who rent which equipment. The Administrator has to log in with his name and a strong password[^1].

**Nice to Have**
Its also welcomed that users can view their own history of lent materials, and the possibility to see whats currently in storage. 

The administrator can create new categories of a material. He/She can also edit user information and delete/create user accounts.

**Won't haves**
This application will not include managing things like food, drinks and other goods that is not part of the equipment of the Nature Friends. Moreover this is not an application to manage a the equipment for the use of accountancy, its only for the understanding of material flow.
