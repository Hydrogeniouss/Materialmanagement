# target situation

Our Project is a administration software to rent equipment inside the organisation of the Naturfreunde (NF). The goal is that less material gets lost and the expenses for replacements are lessened.

**Must Haves**

Equipment can be lent quickly and easily over the application. That is needed because otherwise members will forget or skip it. The same goes for returning equipment. The application must load fast and have a smooth userflow. For the sake of member identification, a name and pin is needed to log in. Moreover a view of the currently borrowed equipment of a member is necessary to ensure the timely returnal of equipment.

An Administrator has to have the possibility to add new Equipment in case the NF complements equipment. Moreover old or broken equipment should be removable.
To Know who has which materials, the administrator should be able to follow who borrowed which equipment. The Administrator has to log in with his name and a strong password[^1].

**Nice to Have**

Its also welcomed that users can view their own history of lent materials, and the possibility to see whats currently in storage. 

The administrator can create new categories of a material. They can also edit user information and delete/create user accounts.

**Won't haves**

This application will not include managing things like food, drinks and other goods that are not part of the equipment of the NF. Moreover this is not an application to manage the equipment for the use of accountancy, its only for streamlining the material flow.
