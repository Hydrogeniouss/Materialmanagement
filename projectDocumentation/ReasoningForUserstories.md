| NR001   | This is the basic function of our application. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation.md).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| NR002   | This is the basic function of our application. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation).                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| NR004   | Members don't have to go to the storage to see what is there. This is useful for members who don't live near the storage. Moreover, decisions over activities can be decided quickly, based on the material in storage.                                                                                         |
| NR005   | Members are able to plan for future Projects.
