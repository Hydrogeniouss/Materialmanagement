| NR001   | This is the basic function of our application. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation.md).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| NR002   | This is the basic function of our application. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| NR003   | With the login, members don't have to write all their contact details etc. all again and a fast borrowing process can be ensured (see NR001). Moreover this is needed for the Admin view, to see who currently has which materials. <br>You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation). |
| NR004   | Members don't have to go to the storage to see what is there. This is useful for members who don't live near the storage. Moreover, decisions over activities can be decided quickly, based on the material in storage.                                                                                            |
| NR005   | Members are able to plan for future Projects. Moreover this could be used as the basis for the inventory check.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| NR006   | Members have to see their currently borrowed materials to ensure the return of the equipment. Members should have an overview of what they have borrowed. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation).                                                                               |

| NR101   | Often new equipment is added to our storage. Therefore we have to add them to our database too.                                                                                                                                                      |
| NR102   | When materials get damaged or is not returned, Administrators have to be able to see where the material is or was. This is one of the basic functions of our application. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation). |
| NR103   | When materials don't get returned, we have to know where they are. This is the basic function of our application. You can also find it in our [project target situation](./TargetSituation).                                                         |
| NR104   | An Administrator has to be able to manage the accounts. It often happens that people forget their pin or other account data. Therefore someone must reset or change their login data.                                                                |
| NR105   | Often, equipment breaks or is at the end of its lifespan. In this cases the Material should be removed.                                                                                                                                              |
| NR106   | It happens, that members forget to bring equipment back to the storage. The reminder should help members to bring back equipment in time.                                                                                                            |
| NR107   | Often, its useful to have the list of materials, members, etc. on paper. Therefore it should be possible to convert the current data into a printable file format.                                                                                   |
